# Sales Summary 1

A simple single-page web application that fetches sales data from `sales.csv`, calculates the total sales for categories less than or equal to 11, and displays the result.

## Features

- Loads data from `sales.csv` using `fetch()`.
- Dynamically calculates the sum of sales for categories with `category <= 11`.
- Displays the total sales rounded to two decimal places.
- Includes basic error handling for data fetching.

## How to Run

1.  Save the provided `index.html` and `sales.csv` files in the same directory.
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

The application will automatically fetch the `sales.csv` file and display the calculated total sales.

## File Structure

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure, styling, and JavaScript for the application.
-   `sales.csv`: The CSV file containing the sales data.
